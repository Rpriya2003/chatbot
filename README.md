Build a Chatbot using if-else

This project is a simple chatbot built using Python’s **if-elif-else** statements. It interacts with the user through a continuous input/output loop, where the program asks the user for a message and responds based on the detected keywords or phrases. If the user greets the bot, it replies with a greeting; if the user asks a specific question like “how are you,” it responds accordingly; and if the input doesn’t match any predefined condition, the bot gives a default reply. The chatbot continues the conversation until the user types “bye,” at which point it ends the loop and exits the program.
